Here’s a detailed yet simple explanation of your React-related questions:

1. Is JSX mandatory for React?
No, JSX is not mandatory in React.

JSX is just a syntax extension for JavaScript that makes writing UI components easier and more readable.
React can work with plain JavaScript using the React.createElement() function, but JSX simplifies the process.
Example without JSX:

javascript
Copy
Edit
React.createElement('div', { className: 'example' }, 'Hello, World!');
Example with JSX:

javascript
Copy
Edit
<div className="example">Hello, World!</div>
2. Is ES6 mandatory for React?
No, ES6 is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended.

Modern React codebases heavily use ES6+ features like classes, arrow functions, destructuring, modules, and let/const.
You can still use React without ES6, but it would require older JavaScript syntax, making your code verbose and harder to maintain.
3. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
{TitleComponent}

This refers to the component itself as a variable or function, not its rendered output.
{<TitleComponent/>}

This renders the component as JSX and outputs its result (return value of render() or function).
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}

This is an alternate syntax for rendering the component, allowing you to pass children inside it.
Use this when you need to include content between the opening and closing tags of the component.
Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
function TitleComponent() {
  return <h1>Title</h1>;
}

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {<TitleComponent />} {/* Renders the component */}
      {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} {/* Same as above */}
    </div>
  );
};
4. How can I write comments in JSX?
Use {/* comment */} for comments inside JSX.

Comments should be wrapped in curly braces and start with /* and end with */.
Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div>
  {/* This is a comment */}
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</div>
5. What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></>?
Both are used to group multiple JSX elements without adding an extra DOM node.

<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>

Explicit syntax for grouping elements.
Can accept attributes like key.
<></>

Shorthand for React.Fragment.
Cannot accept attributes.
Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<React.Fragment>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</React.Fragment>

// Equivalent to:
<>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</>
6. What is Reconciliation in React?
Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently.
React compares the new virtual DOM tree with the old one and updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM.
This process ensures fast updates, as React avoids re-rendering the entire UI unnecessarily.

7. What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is the reconciliation algorithm introduced in React 16.
It makes React more efficient by breaking rendering into small units of work, enabling React to pause, resume, or prioritize tasks.
This improves performance, especially in animations and large applications.
8. Why do we need keys in React?
Keys help React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed.

They improve rendering efficiency by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
Keys should be unique among siblings.
9. Can we use index as keys in React?
Yes, but it's not recommended.

Using indices as keys can cause issues when list items are re-ordered, added, or removed.
It's better to use a unique identifier like an id.
When to use index as keys?

When the list is static, and items don’t change.
10. What is props in React?
Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Props are read-only and immutable.
Ways to use props:

jsx
Copy
Edit
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="John" />
11. What is Config Driven UI?
Config Driven UI refers to building user interfaces dynamically based on a configuration object.
Instead of hardcoding the UI, you define it using JSON or similar structures.
Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const config = [
  { type: 'button', label: 'Click Me' },
  { type: 'text', value: 'Hello World' },
];

function renderUI(config) {
  return config.map((item, index) => {
    if (item.type === 'button') return <button key={index}>{item.label}</button>;
    if (item.type === 'text') return <p key={index}>{item.value}</p>;
    return null;
  });
}
