Difference between Named export, Default export, and * as export
Named Export:

Allows exporting multiple values from a module.
You need to use the exact name when importing.
Syntax for export:
javascript
Copy
Edit
export const name = "John";
export const age = 30;
Syntax for import:
javascript
Copy
Edit
import { name, age } from './module';
Default Export:

Allows exporting a single value or a fallback for a module.
You can import it with any name.
Syntax for export:
javascript
Copy
Edit
export default function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello");
}
Syntax for import:
javascript
Copy
Edit
import greet from './module';
greet(); // Output: Hello
* as export:

Used to import all exports from a module as a single object.
You can access individual exports as properties of that object.
Syntax for export:
javascript
Copy
Edit
export const name = "John";
export const age = 30;
Syntax for import:
javascript
Copy
Edit
import * as data from './module';
console.log(data.name); // John
console.log(data.age); // 30
What are React Hooks?
React Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you use React features like state and lifecycle methods inside functional components, without needing to write class components.

Common hooks include:

useState: To manage state in functional components.
useEffect: To handle side effects like API calls or subscriptions.
useContext: To consume context values.
useRef: To access DOM elements or persist mutable values without causing re-renders.
useMemo and useCallback: For performance optimizations.
Why do we need the useState Hook?
The useState Hook allows functional components to maintain and update their state. Without useState, only class components could manage state using this.state and this.setState.

Key Reasons to Use useState:
State Management in Functional Components:

Enables you to add and manage state variables in functional components.
javascript
Copy
Edit
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(count + 1); // Updates the state
Simpler Syntax:

No need for complex class-based syntax or binding this.
Dynamic UI Updates:

Rerenders the component automatically when state changes.
Improved Readability and Modularity:

Makes code cleaner and easier to maintain by focusing on smaller, reusable functional components.
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
Here, useState initializes the count variable to 0 and provides a function setCount to update it.

what is state

In simple terms, state in React refers to an object or variable that holds dynamic data or values that determine how a component behaves or looks.

State allows components to create, store, and update information that changes over time, enabling them to respond to user interactions, API responses, or other factors.

Key Characteristics of State:
Dynamic:

State can change during the lifecycle of a component.
When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state.
Local to a Component:

State is specific to a component and its children unless explicitly shared (e.g., using props or context).
Triggers UI Updates:

Changes to state are immediately reflected in the UI after React re-renders the component.
Why is State Important?
Without state, components would only display static content. State allows React apps to be interactive and dynamic, such as:

Showing/hiding elements.
Tracking user input (e.g., text fields, buttons).
Updating counters, lists, or fetched data dynamically.
Example of State:
Counter Example Using useState Hook:
javascript
Copy
Edit
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  // Initialize state with a default value of 0
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
Breakdown:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);:

count is the state variable that holds the current counter value.
setCount is the function used to update the value of count.
useState(0) initializes count with 0.
React Updates the UI:

When you click the buttons, setCount changes the state.
React re-renders the component with the updated count.
Key Difference Between Props and State:
Feature	Props	State
Definition	Data passed from a parent to a child component.	Data managed within a component.
Mutable?	Immutable (cannot be changed by the receiving component).	Mutable (can be changed using hooks or this.setState).
Purpose	Used to pass information between components.	Used for handling dynamic data or user interactions within a component.
This dynamic nature of state makes React applications powerful and interactive.
